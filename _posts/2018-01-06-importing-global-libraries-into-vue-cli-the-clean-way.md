If you're working with the Vue CLI and you're trying to import global JS/CSS libraries you're not alone. Some [solutions](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/144) will tell you to just add the package with a require statement or an @import statement. That's fine but there is a time and a place to use the @import statement in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and importing a global CSS library isn't one of them. Instead, let's use an ES6 'import' statement.

## What We Will Be Importing

We will be importing [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), the up-and-coming Flexbox CSS framework. I won't get into too much detail about it here but it's all based on Flexbox. It's very easy to pick up and learn and requires less markup than Bootstrap.

## What We Will Be Doing

For this, we will be creating an alias for our Bulma dependency. This will be very familiar to you if you read my [other post](https://daveberning.io/creating-alias-for-package-imports-in-react) about creating an alias for a React dependency.

For this, I'm assuming that you already have the [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) installed. If not, it's easy to install. Just run **npm install -g vue-cli**, **vue init webpack my-project**, and follow the prompts.

### Creating the Alias

First, to add the dependency let's use run the follow NPM command:

    npm install bulma --save

After that is done, let's dive into our _build/webpack.dev.conf.js_ file and paste the following code right above the _module_ object.

    resolve: {
        extensions: ['.css'],
        alias: {
          'bulma': resolve('node_modules/bulma/css/bulma.css'),
        }
    }

**NOTE:** If you want to use the SCSS file, there are additional steps you should take prior to this article.

Now that your alias is created, let's import it into our _src/main.js_ file. Importing the dependency here will allow it to be used across the entire application.

    import bulma from 'bulma';

That's it! Really.

Granted, you could just add the relative path Bulma but this is much cleaner to read. Plus, you now how to create alias' in Webpack for Vue!
