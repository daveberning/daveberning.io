It’s been a while since my last post but I’m back at it! I’ve been busy working on jump starting my freelance web design shop, [Parsec Digital](http://parsecdigital.io). You know, drafting contracts, creating business cards, and of course...designing the website. Which got me thinking. Should I design in the browser or in Photoshop?

I won’t be offering a TLDR because I think this is a topic worth digging in to. Traditionally, after the initial wireframes, websites are mocked up in a program like Photoshop. That’s how I’ve done it and this is how it’s still done with a lot of people. However, there has been a recent push in the past year or so to start designing in the browser. Each have their pros and cons so let’s discuss.

## Designing in Photoshop

When I talk about “designing in photoshop” I’m also talking about designing in other desktop applications like UXPin, Sketch, and Adobe Experience Design. These tools are great but require the designer to learn a new software and it’s nuances.

If you’re primarily a designer, designing in Photoshop might come natural to you. The main advantage for designing in an application is the ability to focus more on the design than the code. Just be prepared to do the same task multiple times for each breakpoint.

If you’re a graphic designer that knows a small amount of code, designing in Photoshop may come natural to you.

### Pros
- Greater attention to design and composition.
- Greater focus in web performance. With a fully fledged mockup, you can see where the elements will be on the webpage. Your code will be more thought out during development.
- Decreased development time.
- Mockups can easily be referenced during development.
- Shared assets. You can easily grab logos, images, and graphics from the mockup.

### Cons
- Extremely frustrating to do efficiently if you’re primarily a “coder”.
- Have to learn the nuance of the program(s).
- Tasks feel repetitive especially with creating separate mockups for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Essentially you're doing twice the work.
- Can’t easily move from computer to computer. Especially if you’re using custom fonts.
- Large file size.
- Not interactive.

## Designing in the Browser

You’re developing your website for the browser anyway. Why not design it in the browser too? Responsive web design is the standard practice these days and has been for a while. It’s important to see how each element reacts at the various breakpoints.

There are tons of frameworks out there for you to choose from. However, the two most popular ones are [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). These responsive frameworks make designing in the browser a lot easier. Plus, you can easily share your design for them to interact with. In my experience, clients are more likely to be pleased with the design if they can also interact with it and see how it will behave.

If you’re a designer who is efficient at coding, designing in browser may come natural to you.

### Pros
- See how your site will react at various breakpoints
- Don’t have to create separate files for each breakpoint
- View your design at various resolutions and pixel densities
- Easily share your design with clients and other users
- Visualization of website behavior
- Easily reuse code from design to development
- Shared assets. You can easily grab logos, images, and graphics from the design for your website.
- Easily switch from computer to computer when working on your design
- Fonts stay consistent
- Smaller file size

### Cons
- Depending on your coding experience, it can be a slower to design in browser
- Development time may be slower
- More emphasis on code than overall visual design

## Conclusion

Designing is an intimate process. The process of getting from a blank screen to a finish product is often times unique to the designer. Everyone works best with the tools they are most comfortable with; it all depends on what your strengths are. For me personally, I tend to design in the browser. More often than not, I can create a basic webpage quicker than I can create a new layer in Photoshop. As a developer first, designing in the browser is much more efficient both in pre-production and in development. I can easily solve potential problems as they happen, share my progress, and reuse code.
