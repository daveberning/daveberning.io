This article will be going over the technical side of the creation process. I'm not going to talk about the branding or even the UI because 1) I'm technical like that, and 2) I shouldn't have to explain a UI. So, do you even care? Well, if you don't I'm going to tell you anyway.

It started with me realizing that I needed to give a much needed facelift to my website. My previous website was a little "cookie cutter" and dated. It got me through my first job interview, but I needed something with a better UI/UX. I also wanted to utilize a server side language, to better manage the code. However, upon research, there were better, more efficient ways of achieving this.

So, I immediately starting delving into PHP. My background is in Wordpress and PHP so this immediately seemed natural. I chose to use a server side language because, come on...who wants to the same navigation for each page.
