The past few weeks, I've had the urge to jump outside of my close circle of developer friends and see what other developers around town are doing. After all, meeting new developers and viewing their work not only makes you better, but keeps you up-to-date with the industry. Not to mention, you get to build your network up and get introduced to new business and employment opportunities!

I've been working a lot on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/daveberning/pen/ZezVVd/) lately and started exploring their site. They sponsor meetups across the world and provide free "swag" to members that show up! Cincinnati has never had a CodePen meetup so I'm here to change that. I'm in the process of getting a venue but in the meantime, rallying up support for it.

The CodePen meetup will generally start with members presenting or sharing pens they really like, talk about what problems they've overcome, why they decided to write the pen, and what they got out of it. Then segue into a front-end workshop (if needed) or a general discussion about the industry.

If you're in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Area, please follow the event on Twitter [@CodePenCIN](https://twitter.com/CodePenCIN) and use the #CodePenCIN hashtag across social media.

Any details about the upcoming event will be posted on Twitter and my blog.
