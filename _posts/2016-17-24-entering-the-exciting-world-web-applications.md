I started my career like many, creating simple static websites. I remember how exciting it was when I made my first mobile friendly website; it felt like I developed an app. I then moved to eCommerce and I felt like I actually developed a site that _does_ something. I'm now working on web applications that takes data from the back-end that users can interact with on the front-end.

For the past few years, I've seen a growing trend in the need for web applications. This has largely to do with the standardization of apps. It seems like every website has a mobile app companion in the AppStore and Marketplace these days. Unfortunately, it can be expensive to develop a companion app for your website. Each platform has their own language and SDK that you have to learn and manage. Fortunately however, there are web technologies like [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) that allow web developers to create hybrid and native applications for iOS and Android.

## Web Development Isn't Limited to the Browser

Probably the most exciting thing about web development is that it isn't just limited to the browser anymore. There plenty of web packagers like PhoneGap and frameworks like React Native that let web developers create native apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is exciting because we can now develop apps without learning a new technology, making app development cheaper as these "hybrid" apps can be ported to multiple operating systems.

I am currently working on a web app that lets marketers sit down with clients to create a custom home. The app is great and is currently only supported for the desktop. I would eventually like to see this ported to mobile devices to utilize device hardware for a better user experience.

## It's an Exciting Time for Web Development

It's an exciting time to be a web developer. With each day, more features are adopted by browsers that let you do some exciting things like CSS3 keyframes and animations. The field has grown tremendously over the past few years. JavaScript has grown to be a flexible full-stack language that performs well on both the front and back-end with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). There is something for everybody and there is always room for growth as a developer.
