I'm hosting Cincinnati's first CodePen meet up! The meet up will start off with a classic "show and tell", followed by a small workshop if needed, then to a general discussion about the field.

Any and all front-end web developers regardless of skill set and expertise are welcome! Let's all get together, share pens, network, and talk shop. Please RSVP through Nvite below. Details are attached.

You can follow the event on Twitter [@CodePenCIN](https://twitter.com/codepencin) and with the hashtag, [#CodePenCIN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CodePenCIN&src=typd). If you have any questions, please let me know. I hope to see you there!
