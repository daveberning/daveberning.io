<p>I'm Dave Berning, a web developer and designer from Cincinnati, OH. I specialize in front-end web development that adapts to all mobile and desktop devices. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor's Degree of Fine Arts and certifications in web production, video production, and electronic design.</p>

<p>Great websites start with simple and clean code. Every project I tackle is unique and is built in such a way for clients to easily update their content independently. I'm interested to learn more about you and your project. Contact me with any questions and let get started!</p>
