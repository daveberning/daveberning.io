<p>I'm Dave Berning, a <span itemprop="jobTitle">web developer and designer</span> from Cincinnati, OH. I specialize in front-end web development that adapts to all mobile and desktop devices. I graduated from the <span itemprop="alumniOf">University of Cincinnati</span> with a <span itemprop="award">Bachelor's Degree of Fine Arts</span> and certifications in web production, video production, and electronic design.</p>

<p>I have worked with several companies<span itemprop="alumniOf"> over the years, each one giving me valuable experience and new skills. Some of these companies include KalioCommerce, Hobsons Educational Solutions, Upright Communications, and INFODYNAMICS. My philosophy is that every great website should be written with readable code and is easy to use.</p>
