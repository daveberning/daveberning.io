I'm {{site.firstName}} {{site.lastName}}, a web developer and designer from {{site.location}}. I specialize in front-end web development that adapts to all mobile and desktop devices. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor's Degree of Fine Arts and certifications in web production, video production, and electronic design.

Great websites start with simple and clean code. Every project I tackle is unique and is built in such a way for clients to easily update their content independently. I'm interested to learn more about you and your project. Contact me with any questions and let get started!
